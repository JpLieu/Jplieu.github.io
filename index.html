		<h3> My name is Jp, I'm a sophomore at Stratford High School. I'm in the Engineering program, hoping maybe to be a mechnanical enginner. I'm currently doing outdoor track. I procrastinate like it's my job, also being very lazy. I love eating like pizza rolls, steak, ribs, noodles, potato skins with bacon and cheese, hot dogs, chili cheese fries and bacon cheese fries. I also love building things out of popsicle sticks, like houses and crossbows </h3>
